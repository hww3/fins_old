Version 0.1

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

- Fins.Model is no longer the go-to location for finding objects.
    In its place, you want to use context->find and friends. To get 
    a context for your data model, use Fins.DataSource.modelid, where
    _default is the default.
- Default module name for data mapping definitions has changed from
    Appname.Model to Appname.DataMappings. This can be changed by
    creating a class called "defaults" that inherits Fins.Helpers.Defaults
    and overrides these default value names.
- Many model functions have changed to take a DataModelContext object
    as an optional or required argument as a means of supporting multiple
    database connections per model definition. In situations where the 
    context is optional, the default context will be used if a context
    is not provided. 
- FCGI Support requires a recent version of Public.Web.FCGI, as changes
    in the API of this module changed incompatably.
- Simple template changes: foreach argument "var" can now be a variable 
    (preceeded by a '$') or a constant string, as with macro variables.
- Macro syntax: most template macros that accept arguments that are 
    variables located in the template data (usually, they are arguments 
    named "var") can now be a constant string (var="somestring") or the 
    previous behavior when preceeded by a '$' (var="$item.description").

NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

- ScaffoldController is now a DocController for consistency purposes.
- Added some abstraction functions to FinsModel and DataModelContext in
     order to enable models and context configuration to be overriden.
- Tools.Logging.Log.Appender now encodes output as UTF-8 in order to
     prevent exceptions when writing log messages with wide strings.
- Macros output exception information to the main logging system (in the 
     logger fins.template.render) and should be more useful, including 
     source template and line as well as macro code and line.
- Added context_root macro.
- Added Fins.Model.SortCriteria()
- Added --model argument to ModelBuilder to specify which model to use 
    (when multiple model definitions exist).
- Added DataModelContext()->start_transaction and friends. Needs some 
    additional work to behave when model level autocommit is turned off.
- Added Fins.DataSource as the entry point for multiple model definitions.
- The default model config section can specify an id, which can be used
    to retrieve a context handle (in addition to using _default). 
- Revamped Fins.Model.Repository (finding objects moved to DataModelContext),
    and Fins.Model.module (no longer an instance of Repository).
- Multiple data models can be defined by specifying additional sections
    in the application config file in the form [model_(identifer)] where
    id, datasource, definition_module and debug are required values.  
- Added Configuration.get_sections()
- Appname.Model is now Appname.DataMappings, for clarity. (see 
    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES section above)
- Support for multiple database connections (see INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES 
    above for notes on potential compatibility concerns)
- Added DataModelContext->clone() to create a clone of the context
    with a new database connection.
- Added DataModelContext->find as a context/connection specific method
    of retrieving objects. Model.find continues to work with the 
    default context/connection.
- Added action_form macro.
- Added DataObject->has_many_to_many() in order to simplify creation of
    many to many relationships where the join table is not named in a
    standard fashion and/or special attribute names are desired in the
    generated objects. 
- New applications created with pike -x fins get a fins.sh script that can 
    be used to run the fins tool more easily (similar to start.sh).
- Access logging is now performed properly; output is in Common Log Format.
- Model automatically detects fields with a UNIQUE key, and uses the first
    in each table as the alternate key when using config via reflection.
- Added Fins.Model.MetaDataField, which provides a "shadow" field that
    stores a mapping of data in another field. Useful for storing data
    that's transient or not otherwise easily stored in a field of its own.
- DateFields and its derivatives accept time fractions (such as the result 
    of Calendar.now().)
- Added LMTP and SMTP processors. Currently, there's not much glue, so
    you'd need to implement the callbacks (which currently accept any
    mail delivered.)
- Added HTTPRequest->get_client_addr() which is X-Forwarded-For aware. 
    Note that the X-F-F header is easily spoofed, so do not use this
    in situations where this would be dangerous.
- Added cast() to Model.DataObjectInstance, to make it easier to get
    a mapping containing the contents of the object.
- Added support for controlling FinServe's session configuration values
    (storage type, location and session timeout) from the app config file.
- Added text="" option to language_selector macro to specify text in front
    of the dropdown control. Value defaults to "Language:"
- Errors generated during template compilation are now handled more 
     consistently; they are less likely to be swallowed, and are
     presented to the client uniformly.
- Fins.StaticController added, which allows static directories to be
     served from within an app, much like /static/ is served by default.
- templates that render to wide strings are now automatically encoded
     as UTF-8 before being returned to the client.
- ePike templates can call macros using the syntax: <%#macroname%>, 
    with arguments passed as though a mapping, without the ([]). Example:
    <%#humanize "var": "standard_id"%>
- New template type "ePike" provides simple PSP embedded pike syntax for 
    situations where Simple templates are not expressive enough.
- Autodetection of Model fields works properly for floats
    (Christian Ress)
- Added <%available languages name="varname"%> and <%language_selector%>
    macros for generating custom and standard language selectors, 
    respectively.
- All of the *Request objects treat the presence of a _lang variable 
    specially as a way to set the LOCALE manually (instead of using 
    browser headers) for this to work, request->get_lang() must be called 
    on the page that receives the request with _lang variable, which is 
    any page that uses a localized string, or the language macros.
- Added L10n support in template files using <%@project name="project"%>
    and <%LOCALE id="n" string="string to translate"%>
- New applications have a locale extractor configuration automatically 
    created as config/locale.xml, and translation strings folder structure 
    in translations/. 
- New Locale Extractor added (pike -x fins extract_locale) with support for
    Simple templates.
- FinsController->start() is now called as a callout in order to allow
    the root of the controller tree to populate first. 
- Simple template/PSP behavior change: if the result of a variable 
    replacement is not found (ie, has a zero_type() as in a mapping without 
    the requested index), the substitution will return an empty string rather 
    than a zero (0).
- Extended the Runner interface so that actions that return Runners (like 
    DocController and filters work properly with url_for_action and friends.
- Controllers that return runners must retain identity for a given action 
    in order for url_for_action to work properly.
- Response.redirect() generates proper absolute URLs in most cases now 
    (the exception being HTTP/1.0 requests in standalone mode and 
     possibly FCGI/SCGI requests).
- added __quiet flag to DocController, which hushes warnings in the debug log
    generated by events without corresponding templates.
- pragma is always available in request
- DocController won't try to locate layouts each request, only the first
    time and when presented with pragma->nocache.
- Added dump_data macro
- Session storage is now available in template data as "session"
- Added support for caching event lookups. This can improve performance
    when controller reloading is not enabled for certain request patterns. 
    Configuration key "cache_events" in the "controller" secion is used 
    to turn this functionality on.
- Added support for "around filters" to controllers. 
- Added Tools.Zip, with support for reading and writing basic Zip files.
- Added Tools.Mapping.MappingCache, a mapping that forgets entries after a 
    predefined time.
- Fixed Fins.Model.find.* for object types that have odd capitalization;
    everything is all lowercase now.

    that provide unique constraint information (mysql in pike 7.7). 
- added get_session_by_id() to Fins.Request.

- pike -x fins start now uses -c|--config= configname, instead of the 
    config being specified using the last command line argument
